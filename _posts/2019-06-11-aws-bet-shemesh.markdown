There is a first time for everything. Wednesday, June 12, 2019, will be the first of many tech milestones for Bet Shemesh. SifraDigital, a boutique digital media & software consulting firm, is hosting Amazon Web Services. The event will occur on June 12th, 2019 and starts at 4:00 PM at Sifra's Bet Shemesh office.

Amazon will share details of it's "Activate" program for startups. An AWS engineer will also give a talk to the local developer community.

It is rare for tech companies to take part in events outside of tech centers like Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

###### What is special about Bet Shemesh?

Bet Shemesh is beginning to undergo a change and large companies are taking note.

>>Mayor Aliza Bloch has announced concrete plans to bring the tech economy to the city. Actions already taken include zoning large areas for hi-tech and opening an accelerator.

Bet Shemesh has a natural advantage as the midway point between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem.

Bet Shemesh also has a large population of educated tech workers who commute to work outside of the city. These motivated professionals would like to see more job opportunities within the city.

This year alone has brought more than **20 new startups to the city**.

**Ikea is opening 3 offices in Bet Shemesh** in the next month. There is a lot more going on that I can't share yet.

When I speak to business contacts I give my location as "near Tel Aviv". Within 10 years there will be nobody in the tech world who hasn't heard of Bet Shemesh.

The way to register for the event is by having a conversation with "Reggie, the registration robot". You can find Reggie at [www.sifradigital.com/aws-ai-event][1].
